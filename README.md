## Introduction
Python is a high-level, interpreted, and general-purpose programming language known for its simplicity, readability, and wide range of applications.  
It is designed to enable developers to write clear and logical code for small and large-scale projects.

## History of Python
- Python was created by **Guido van Rossum**.
- Development started in the late **1980s** and first released in **1991**.
- Python was designed as a successor to the ABC language.
- The name “Python” was inspired by the TV show *Monty Python’s Flying Circus*.
- Python is now maintained by the **Python Software Foundation (PSF)**.
